# PizzaTutorial
This repository is for running the Pizza tutorial which will be used in the module "Knowledge-based Systems".

Currently, the project is based on OWL-API version 3.5.0. We look forward to integrate the next current release of the OWL-API. Support is always welcome!

The Project uses maven for dependency management.
